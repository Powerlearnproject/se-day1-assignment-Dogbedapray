#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Answer: Software engineering is a discipline that involves the application of engineering principles, methods and tools design, build, and maintain software systems that reliable, efficient and of high quality. In simple terms, the whole process invloves design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is that it helps us to creat reliable, cost-effective, and scalable applications and systems for communication, commerce, entertainment, healthcare,education and other aspects of our lives.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
Answer: Three key milestones and their description are as follow;
1. The Development of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s);
High-level programming languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) were introduced to replace machine code and assembly language, used then to programme computers and were cumbersome and error-prone. This laid the foundation for software engineering by making programming more accessible and efficient. It also enabled the development of more complex software systems and opened up the field to a broader range of people.
2. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s);
The "software crisis," in which projects were frequently delivered late, over budget, and with a high number of bugs, gave rise to structured programming. Structured programming,  promoted the use of control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines and discouraged the use of unstructured jumps.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s;
Software development methodologies underwent a dramatic change with the publication of The Agile Manifesto in 2001. Agile placed a strong emphasis on working with customers to create iteratively and adapting to changing requirements. This was not the conventional waterfall model, which was more inflexible and linear.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer; 
i). Requirement; In this phase, the specific requirements of the software system, as well as the users need are gathered and documented.
ii). Design; Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface, including the overall system structure, the database design, the user interface, and how different components will interact.
iii). Implementation: During the implementation phase, the actual code for the software is written based on the design specifications. 
iv). Testing; In this phase, tests are conducted to ensure that the software meets uality standards and functional requirements and is free of defects.
v). Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers for it to be used after passing the test.
vi). Maintenance: This involves monitoring the software, providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment to ensure that the software runs smoothly.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer; 
Waterfall and Agile methodologies are both software development methodologies. Waterfall uses sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. It has distinct phases such as requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 
Agile is an iterative, incremental and flexible approach where the project is divided into small cycles called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. It  involves continuous cycles of planning, design, development, testing, and review within each sprint.
Agile is highly flexible and can adapt to changing requirements, while Waterfall is more rigid and follows a fixed sequence.
Agile is often better for larger, more complex projects, whereas Waterfall is more suited to smaller, well-defined projects.
Waterfall places a strong emphasis on documentation, whereas Agile focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation.
Agile involves continuous customer and stakeholder feedback, while Waterfall generally involves customers mainly at the beginning and end of the project.
Scenarios; Projects with stable, well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change are good candidates for waterfall development. For example, creating a software for a regulatory environment where compliance requirements are well-known and fixed.  Agile is best suited for projects where requirements are not fully known at the beginning or are expected to change, like creating a mobile app where future features are determined by user feedback. An enterprise software platform with several modules is also an example of a large, complex project that is best suited for agile development since it allows for iterative testing and improvements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: 
Software developers write and execute code to produce software that complies with design specifications. Quality Assurance Engineer plans, runs, and automates tests to identify and fix bugs in the software to guarantee it is of the highest quality. Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire project and ensuring successful completion by managing resources, schedules, risks, and communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) integrates all necessary tools for writing, debugging, and testing code in one environment. Example, Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. It ensures that code changes are tracked, managed, and merged effectively. Examples are Git, Subversion and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer; 
The chalenges are; I).Dealing with Changing Requirements. ii).Time Management and Meeting Deadlines. ii).Handling Technical Debt. iii).Handling Stress and Burnout. iv).Managing Complex Codebases. v).Staying Current with Rapidly Changing Technologies
The strategies are; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer;
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. It has an importance of early detection and fixing of bugs, preventing regreion and ensuring code quality.
Integration Testing: Focuses on verifying the interactions between different units or components of the software. It helps to detect interface issues, ensures collaboration and set the foundation for system testing.
System Testing: Evaluates the complete and integrated software application as a whole. It validates the entire system, and helps to identify system-level issues.
Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing,where the software is tested against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It reduces risk of post-release issues, ensures business requirements are met and ensures user satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts or instructions to guide an AI model such as Chat GPT, Gemini, and Perplexity towards a desired outcome. It's essentially the language you use to interact with and direct an AI system. A good prompt usually reflects the persona, context, exemplar, tone, task, and format.
Prompt engineering ensures; 
Precision and Clarity: A well-crafted prompt ensures that the AI understands your request accurately, minimizing misunderstandings and irrelevant responses.
Task Specificity: Tailored prompts can guide the AI towards a specific task or goal, ensuring it provides the most relevant and helpful information.
Bias Mitigation: Careful prompt design can help mitigate biases that might be present in the AI model's training data or algorithms.
Creativity and Innovation: By experimenting with different prompts, you can encourage the AI to generate creative and unexpected outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague promt; Give me a title for story I am writing for my social media page.
Improved prompt; I am a public health activist writing a story on dengue fever. Using a professional tone write a story title of five words for my story to be published on Instagram. Below is the story I wrote.
